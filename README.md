# Keras machine learning models

### The purpose of this repo is to learn some machine/deep learning on my own using open-soruce datasets.

1. Simple iris classification model on sklrean iris dataset.
2. Dogs vs cats classifier implementation built on [Kaggle dogs vs cats 
dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats)
3. Predicting a Pulsar Star model built on [Kaggle pulsar star dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/predicting-a-pulsar-star)
